I couldn't get multiple source files to work after trying common solutions from the internet. I included the those files in proj8mult folder.
My final submission for this project is just the matrix.cpp and makefile in the main proj8 directory. 

I got the covariance but I could not understand how to get the correlation correctly. 
Program syntax: ./matrix iris.dat
